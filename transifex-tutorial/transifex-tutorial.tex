\section*{Step 1: Registering a new user account}

\section*{Step 2: Finding the project you will work on}

Let's assume you have been assigned to the ``Atomic Combinations 1'' resource under the ``Physical Science Grade 11'' project. Clicking on the ``Projects'' link at the top of the page should take you to a page that looks like this:
\begin{center}
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/selectproject.png}}
\end{center}
If you are a member of any translation teams, you will see a link under ``Participating in xxx teams'' in the above image. Click on the link that says ``Physical Science Grade 11'' (or whichever project you are contributing to).

You will then see the resources that have been uploaded to the project. The Siyavula team will do this. Look for the link that says ``Atomic Combinations 1'':
